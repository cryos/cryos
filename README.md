I am an open source software developer. I am a group leader for the Scientific Data Analysis and Visualization group at NSLS-II which is part of Brookhaven National Laboratory. What does that mean? In theory develop open source software that serves the scientific community, moving to focus on the user interfaces, user experiences, AI-enabled software and data visualization. The group was formed in March of 2023 and so we are at the beginning of focusing on these areas.

I am a physicist by training, completing a degree and Ph.D. in physics focusing on nanomaterial engineering. I used lots of materials characterization techniques including transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray and neutron techniques (mainly diffraction and reflectometry) as an experimentalist before making the leap to software. I did a postdoc in chemistry, spent over a decade developing primarily C++ applications before moving to the lab.

I love science and software, living in the space the two occupy. I used to [blog][blog] (and am working on getting back in the habit), have largely abandoned social media, and love living close to the beach. I once gave a TEDx talk ['Open Up or Perish'][tedx] shortly after my daughter was born that sums up my hopes for how we move science forward. Started out as a Google Summer of Code student, and am now mentor/org admin.

I am passionate about writing portable, highly performant software that can run on Linux, macOS, Windows, and on the web. I have deep experience in C++, Qt, CMake and am pretty familiar with Python, TypeScript, React and related technologies. I was once a Gentoo developer, run Arch as my preferred desktop/laptop and love keeping up with new developments in the technology world.
