I work at Voltron Data leading a lot of the build engineering and related work there. I was a Group Leader at NSLS-II (part of Brookhaven National Laboratory), and before that I was a Technical Leader at Kitware working on a number of open source scientific software projects including Avogadro, Open Chemistry, Tomviz, VTK, ParaView, CMake and others. I [blog][blog], have largely abandoned social media, and love living close to the beach.

I am passionate about writing portable, highly performant software that can run on Linux, macOS, Windows, and on the web. I have deep experience in C++, Qt, CMake and am pretty familiar with Python, TypeScript, React and related technologies. I was once a Gentoo developer, and I run Arch Linux as my preferred desktop/laptop and love keeping up with new developments in the technology world. I have contributed to a wide variety of open source projects over the years.

I am a physicist by training, completing a B.Sc. and Ph.D. in physics focusing on nanomaterial engineering. I used lots of materials characterization techniques including transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray and neutron techniques (mainly diffraction and reflectometry) as an experimentalist before making the leap to software. At the end of my Ph.D. I took part in Google Summer of Code as a student, then later a mentor and org admin.

I love science and software, trying to figure out where I might exist in the space the two occupy. I once gave a TEDx talk ['Open Up or Perish'][tedx] shortly after my daughter was born that sums up my hopes for how we move science forward. I have given a few keynotes, many invited talks and many conference talks at software, open source and scientific conferences including OSCON, GTC, All Things Open, ACS, APS, ToScA, M&S, MRS and others.

Views are my own (obviously I would hope).
