I am an open source software developer. I am a group leader in the data science and systems integration program at NSLS-II which is part of Brookhaven National Laboratory. What does that mean? In theory develop open source software that serves the scientific community, in practice I automate a lot of deployment with Red Hat Tower, Red Hat Automation Platform, white a lot of Ansible, and ensure beamlines remain operational.

I am a physicist by training, completing a degree and Ph.D. in physics focusing on nanomaterial engineering. I used lots of materials characterization techniques including transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray and neutron techniques (mainly diffraction and reflectometry) as an experimentalist before making the leap to software.

I love science and software, living in the space the two occupy. I [blog][blog], am active on social media, and love fast cars and motorbikes. I once gave a TEDx talk ['Open Up or Perish'][tedx] shortly after my daughter was born that sums up my hopes for how we move science forward. Started out as a Google Summer of Code student, and now mentor/org admin.

I am passionate about writing portable, highly performant software that can run on Linux, macOS, Windows, and on the web. I have deep experience in C++, Qt, CMake and am pretty familiar with Python, TypeScript, React and related technologies. I was once a Gentoo developer, run Arch as my preferred desktop/laptop and love keeping up with new developments in the technology world.
